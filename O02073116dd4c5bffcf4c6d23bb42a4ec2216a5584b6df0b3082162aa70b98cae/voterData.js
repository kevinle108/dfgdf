If no candidate receives a majority of first choice votes, an instant runoff re-tabulation shall be promptly conducted|56.1|129.4|0|10| by the City Clerk and completed within five \\(5\\) business days of the election. The instant runoff re-tabulation shall be|56.1|145.6|0|10| conducted in successive rounds, with the majority determined for each successive round by the number of votes cast|56.1|161.7|0|10| in that round. The candidate with the fewest votes after each successive round in which no candidate receives a|56.1|177.8|0|10| majority of the votes cast in that round shall be eliminated, and the votes in the successive rounds shall be|56.1|193.9|0|10| re-tabulated among the remaining candidates until one candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in that round.|56.1|210|0|10| In each successive round, each voter's ballot shall count as a single vote for whichever candidate the voter has|56.1|226.1|0|10| ranked highest who has not been eliminated in a prior round, if any.|56.1|242.2|0|10| |56.1|250.3|0|10| iv. After the first round, a majority is determined as at least one \\(1\\) more than fifty percent \\(50%\\) of the votes cast for|56.1|266.4|0|10| a remaining candidate in a particular round.|56.1|282.5|0|10| |56.1|290.6|0|10| v. The City Clerk may adopt additional regulations consistent with this subsection to implement these provisions. The|56.1|306.7|0|10| ballot shall contain instructions on how to vote for each office.|56.1|322.8|0|10| [The entirety of subsection B was added to Section 6.2.]|56.1|338.9|0|10| |56.1|346.9|0|10| Section 6.5.

It shall be determined by dividing the total|56.1|580.6|0|10| number of valid ballots by one more than the total number of candidates to be elected and adding one to the result,|56.1|596.7|0|10| disregarding fractions. Whenever at any stage of the counting the number of ballots credited to a candidate becomes|56.1|612.8|0|10| equal to the quota, that candidate shall be declared elected, and no ballots in excess of the quota shall be credited to|56.1|628.9|0|10| that candidate except as provided in \\(f\\) or \\(l\\) of this section.|56.1|645|0|10| \\(d\\) The ballots shall be sorted according to the first choices marked on them.|56.1|661.1|0|10| \\(e\\) If a candidate is elected while the ballots are being sorted according to first choices, any subsequent ballots which|56.1|677.2|0|10| show that candidate as first choice shall each be credited to the second choice marked on it, or, if the second choice|56.1|693.3|0|10| also has been elected, to the next choice marked on it for a candidate not yet elected.|56.1|709.4|0|10| \\(f\\) If during the first sorting of ballots, ballots are found which are marked for a candidate already elected as first|56.1|725.6|0|10| choice, but show no clear choice for any unelected candidate, such ballots shall at the end of the sorting be given to|56.1|741.7|0|10| the candidate of their first choice, and in their place an equal number, as nearly as possible, of the last ballots sorted|56.1|757.8|0|10| to that candidate which show a clear choice for unelected candidates, all as determined by the City Clerk, shall be|56.1|773.9|0|10| taken and re-sorted to unelected candidates as if they were then being sorted for the first time.|56.1|790|0|10| \\(g\\) When all the ballots have been thus sorted and credited to the first available choices marked on them, every|56.1|806.1|0|10| candidate who is credited with fewer ballots than the number of signatures required for that candidate's nomination|56.1|822.2|0|10| shall be declared defeated.|56.1|838.3|0|10| \\(h\\) All the ballots of the candidates thus defeated shall be transferred, each to the candidate indicated on it as next|56.1|854.4|0|10| choice among the continuing candidates.

This principle shall be applied successively as many times as may be necessary, a tie shown at any stage of the|56.1|81.1|0|10| count being decided by referring to the standing of the tied candidates immediately prior to the last preceding transfer|56.1|97.2|0|10| of ballots.  In interpreting this and other rules contained in this section the transfer of all ballots from candidates|56.1|113.3|0|10| defeated together under rule \\(g\\) of this section, and the transfer of all ballots from each candidate defeated thereafter|56.1|129.4|0|10| shall each constitute a single separate transfer.|56.1|145.6|0|10| \\(l\\) Whenever candidates to the number to be elected have received the quota, any transfer of ballots in progress|56.1|161.7|0|10| when the last quota was reached shall be completed, but immediately thereafter all continuing candidates shall be|56.1|177.8|0|10| declared defeated and the election shall be at an end. Whenever all ballots of all defeated candidates have been|56.1|193.9|0|10| transferred, and it is impossible to defeat another candidate without reducing the continuing candidates below the|56.1|210|0|10| number still to be elected, all the continuing candidates shall be declared elected and the election shall be at an end.|56.1|226.1|0|10| \\(m\\) A record of the count shall be kept in such form as to show, after each sorting or transfer of ballots, the number|56.1|242.2|0|10| thereby credited to each candidate, the number thereby set aside as exhausted, the total for each candidate, the total|56.1|258.3|0|10| set aside as exhausted, and the total number of valid ballots found by adding the totals of all candidates and the total|56.1|274.4|0|10| set aside as exhausted.|56.1|290.6|0|10| \\(n\\) Every ballot that is transferred from one candidate to another shall be stamped or marked so that its entire course|56.1|306.7|0|10| from candidate to candidate can be conveniently traced.|56.1|322.8|0|10| \\(o\\) If at any time after the first sorting of the ballots a ballot is found to have been credited to the wrong candidate, it|56.1|338.9|0|10| may be transferred, as part of the transfer that is in progress, to the continuing candidate, if any, to whom it should|56.1|355|0|10| have been credited at the time the error was made, or, if it should previously have become exhausted, may be set|56.1|371.1|0|10| aside as exhausted as part of the transfer that is in progress; provided, that if the number of misplaced ballots found|56.1|387.2|0|10| is sufficient to make it possible that any candidate has been wrongly defeated, so much of the sorting and|56.1|403.3|0|10| transferring as may be required to correct the error shall be done over again before the count proceeds. If in|56.1|419.4|0|10| correcting an error any ballots are re-sorted or re-transferred, every ballot shall be made to take the same course that|56.1|435.6|0|10| it took in the original count unless the correction of an error requires its taking a different course. The principles of the|56.1|451.7|0|10| rules of this section shall apply also to any recount which may be made after the original count has been completed.|56.1|467.8|0|10| [All subsections a-o of Section 6.5 were added in their entirety.]|56.1|483.9|0|10| |56.1|491.9|0|10| If it shall appear that there is no choice of Mayor, or any of the other officers to be elected from the citizens at large,|56.1|508.1|0|10| or from any of the several wards, or if the person elected Mayor, or any person or persons elected to any other of the|56.1|524.2|0|10| offices aforesaid, shall refuse to accept the office, or shall die before qualifying, or if a vacancy in the office of Mayor|56.1|540.3|0|10| shall occur subsequently and more than three \\(3\\) months previous to the expiration of the municipal year, warrant|56.1|556.4|0|10| shall forthwith be issued for a new election, and the same proceedings shall be had in all respects as hereinbefore|56.1|572.5|0|10| provided, and shall be repeated until such election is completed.|56.1|588.6|0|10| |56.1|596.7|0|10| A vacancy occurring in the City Council by death, resignation or removal from the City of any member thereof, shall|56.1|612.8|0|10| be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining members present and voting, voting by roll call;|56.1|628.9|0|10| and if such vacancy be occasioned by the death, resignation or removal from the City of a member elected by a|56.1|645|0|10| ward, the same shall be filled from the ward where it occurs.|56.1|661.1|0|10| |56.1|669.2|0|10| A vacancy occurring in the School Committee by death, resignation or removal from the city, of any member thereof,|56.1|685.3|0|10| shall be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining members present and voting, from the ward|56.1|701.4|0|10| where it occurs, or if at large from any ward.||4|1|55|707.5|785|707.5||2|3|3| Option 1 of 2||2|6|4|6|716|727.5|1|10| Yes|719.8|743.6|0|0.1|  not selected.||6|1.5|757|715|20|15|0||4|1|55|737.5|785|737.5||2|3|3| Option 2 of 2||2|6|4|6|722.8|757.5|1|10| No|726.6|773.6|0|0.1|  not selected.||6|1.5|757|745|20|15|0||4|2|55|767.5|785|767.5||4|2.5|55|45|785|45||5|1.5|55|45|730|990|0||7|BALLOT_498461.PDF`
